# Methods-in-Computational-Physics
This repository contains the Fortran Codes of various Methods used in computational physics like Monte Carlo, Verlet Algorithm, etc. 

All codes of the respective computational methods are present in their folders. Also, it contains a .gnu file to plot the output and may include the histogram.f90 file if a histogram is required. 

The assign01.pdf, assign02.pdf, assign03.pdf, assign04.pdf and assign05.pdf contain the questions used to create the codes. Please have a look at them to understand the codes better. 

Enjoy learning computational physics!
